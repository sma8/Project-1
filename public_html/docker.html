	<h1>Docker Hub and Docker Desktop</h1>
	<a href="index.html">Return to Main Page</a>
	<div>Docker is a platform used to build and run images from <br>
		applications. Docker Desktop is a program that is used <br>
		to run those images as containers. Multiple containers with <br>
		databases can also be used to persist data on the containers. <br>
		Docker Hub is used to host the images in repositories, which <br>
		can be used with Azure to run the image as a container online.<br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
		In order run an app through Docker, a <b>Dockerfile</b> (with no <br>
		file extension) needs to be made. This file creates the image <br>
		that works with Docker. A <b>docker-compose.yml</b> file also needs to <br>
		be created, which determines the version, type of image to use, <br>
		the port to run the image on, SQL user and passwords for MYSQL, <br>				and much more.
